How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Bug usually occurs at the editting. Therefore, view the diff between two
    versions could give the developer a clear concept about where the problem
    is.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It could give you a clear view about every change in the code without check
    out the entire code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You can choose when to create a commit to avoid lots of unrelated commits.
    Cons: It is difficult to choose the commit time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Related files should be committed together. It is easy to see the difference
    between each version.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log will show all the commits that have been created. Git diff could be used
    to check the difference between two commits. Therefore, the history of files could
    be viewed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    There is a record about what you changed each time. So, you have the view about
    what changed each time, and could be easier to revert to the previous version if
    the change is proved to be wrong.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use Git for version control of the Android APP that I will develop later.
